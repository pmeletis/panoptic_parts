## Introduction

This repository contains code and tools for reading, processing, and visualizing *Cityscapes-Panoptic-Parts* and *PASCAL-Panoptic-Parts* datasets. We created these datasets by extending two established datasets for image scene understanding, namely [Cityscapes](https://github.com/mcordts/cityscapesScripts "Cityscapes") and [PASCAL](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2010/ "PASCAL") datasets.

Detailed description of the datasets and various statistics are presented in our technical report in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07944 "arxiv.org"). Please cite us if you find our work useful and you use it for your research:
