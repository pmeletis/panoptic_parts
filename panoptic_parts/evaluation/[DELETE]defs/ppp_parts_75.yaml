  - PASCAL Panoptic Parts 74 parts classes + 1 background
  - This is our official grouping for the 198 (363 distinct) annotated parts of PASCAL-Part dataset to 74 part-level classes (194 + 4 parts in total)
  - part-level classes are defined on the 20 scene-level semantic classes of PASCAL VOC
  - 70 parts come from 16 scene-level semantic classes and 4 parts from the rest 4 classes that are not annotated on part-level (or equivalently they have one part)
  - 1 background class is also defined
