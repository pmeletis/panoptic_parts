  - This is a YAML file containing definitions for a dataset
  - any comments can go under the comments key
  - sids are the integer semantic-level ids, by convention sids are zero-based
  - valid_sids is the subset of sids that we consider
  - max_sid is the maximum sid that can exist in label files
  - sid2name is a mapping from sids to names
  - sid2color is a mapping from sids to colors
  - sid2name and sid2color can optionally have an unlabeled/void/don't care key represented by -1, that will match sids not in validsids
  - keys of sid2name and sid2color must at least cover all valid_sids
valid_sids: [list of int]
max_sid: int
sid2name: mapping int -> str
sid2color: mapping int -> [list of int representing [0, 255] RGB color]
